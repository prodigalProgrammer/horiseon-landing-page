# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

Horiseon hired me to refactor their existing landing page and improve the accessibility within the HTML document.
This will ensure a greater experience for any end users with disabilities like visual impairments, and allow search engines to find the site easier.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website is now fully accessible, with links in the Navigation Bar that take you to different areas of the page. Below the landing page image are three sections that detail the services Horiseon will help the client maintain and improve upon.

There is also a side-bar for the number of benifits that come with Horiseon's assistance as a by-product. Lastly there is a footer displaying the Horiseon company name.

## Features / Changes

Here are some of the features I have implemented on the website:

- The title has changed from 'website' to 'Horiseon: Social Solution Services'.
- All links to images now work.
- Alt attributes added which describe the images throughout the site.
- HTML tags changed to more descriptive semantic tags
